# Theme: Radio Localized

## Notes

  * This is an entirely custom built theme, a modified
    version of the theme I built for my (Drupal 8) portfolio
    web site at http://richardgilbert.co
  * My preferred workflow is Gulp with LiveReload.  I also enjoy
    BrowserSync, but as I began this theme ages ago, I have decided to maintain
    its original workflow.
  * I have endeavored to keep all node modules up to date.
  * The Sass structure is what I would call "semi-atomic": I don't stick to the
    strict method proposed by Brad Frost, but I do take some cues from its top-down
    modular structure.
